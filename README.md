# Hexagon Metricts

Realizing there's not much code out there helping beginners with hexagons, I've publish these two files hoping it'll help.
1. Inside mectricts.py you'll find two classes, making you able to create hexagon objects, either flat or pointy orientation.
2. Inside grid.py, you'll find one class to create a grid with the above hexagon objects with a desired width and length.

Good luck, and code on :goat:
